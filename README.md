# Black Friday Purchase Prediction
## Exploratory Data Analysis Project

In this python project, I am trying to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) across the dataset and transform the dataset to make it ready for model building. 

<div>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
A retail company "ABC Private Limited" wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics <i>(age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city)</i>, product details <i>(product_id and product category)</i> and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

- Senior management of shopping malls and stores
- Suppliers of the product categories mentioned in the dataset
- Customers of those product categories

### Data Sources
This project is based on [Black Friday Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdolezel/black-friday) dataset.

### Technology and Tools
I will be using 
- Mathematical and statistical libraries for Python such as **Numpy, Pandas**
- Visualization Python libraries such as **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** Machine Learning library for Python

### Analytic Techniques
**Descriptive Statistics** wil be used to derive valueable insights from the data.
